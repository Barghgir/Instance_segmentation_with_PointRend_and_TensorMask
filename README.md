This repository is about train and validating TensorMask and PointRend models in Detectron2 with the custom dataset.
I put the dataset that I created with Roboflow, here. I used google colab for running these models, so if you want to use your PC, run with GPU.
I used [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/tree/main) so before running these models, please first install the requirements.
