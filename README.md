This repository is about train and validating TensorMask and PointRend models in Detectron2 with the custom dataset.
I put the dataset that I created with Roboflow, here. I used google colab for running these models, so if you want to use your PC, run with GPU.
I used [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/tree/main) so before running these models, please first install the requirements.
For more information, you can use these links:
- [TensorMask model main repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/tree/main/projects/TensorMask)
- [PointRend model main repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/tree/main/projects/PointRend)
- [Detectron2 document](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Use Castum dataset in Detectron2](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/datasets.html)
